# Gene-set Distance Analysis (GSDA)

Identifying sets of related genes (gene-sets) empirically associated with treatment
or phenotype yields valuable interpretative insights on involved biological processes. Complex 
forms of gene-set associations remain difficult to identify. Through this publically available 
package, we provide the gene-set distance analysis (GSDA) by generalizing distance correlations to evaluate
the association of a gene set with categorical and censored event-time variables. A recursive backward 
elimination procedure to identify a subset of genes that most strongly associates with
the variable of interest.
